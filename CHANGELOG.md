* Support single file for intersect command.
* Add only valid zoom levels to TOI.

v1.7.0
------
* **New features:**
    * Add new command that 'gardens' the tiles of interest set to add and remove tiles based on various rules. See [#176](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/176), [#178](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/178), [#179](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/179), [#180](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/180), [#182](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/182), [#183](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/183), [#184](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/184), and [#189](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/189).
* **Enhancements:**
    * When enqueueing tiles of interest for seed rendering, enqueue at zoom level 15 instead of 16. See [#181](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/181).
    * Add optional support for `statsd` in command.py. See [#185](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/185).

v1.6.0
------
* **New features:**
    * Add support for 2x2 metatiles (and 512px tiles). See [#163](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/163), [#166](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/166), and [#169](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/169).
    * Cut child 256px tiles from 512px parent in the 2x2 metatile, rather than re-requesting that 256px bbox from database. See [#158](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/158).
    * Pass nominal zoom instead of coordinates. See [#161](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/161).
* **Enhancements:**
    * Drop parts of MultiPolygons which lie outside the clip boundary of the tile (primarily affects buildings and water layers). See [#171](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/171).
    * Make queue sizes configurable, and default to smaller queue size to accomodate larger 2x2 metatiles. See [#172](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/172).
    * Move existing tiles of interest (TOI) instead of copying it to avoid AWS Redis failover. See [#122](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/122).
    * Load new TOI from file 'toi.txt', just as the TOI dump process saves to 'toi.txt'. See [#122](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/122).
* **Bug fixes:**
    * Delete rejected jobs from SQS queue. See [#173](https://github.com/tilezen/tilequeue/pull/173).

* Metatile at z16
* Support storing individual formatted layers
* Pass context object to post-process functions.
* Add resource abstraction to manage transforms with io requirements
* Don't filter out small features at z16, which may be needed for subsequent zooms

v0.7.1
------
* Eliminate extra slash in S3 filename. [Issue](https://github.com/mapzen/tilequeue/pull/65).
* Update `make_queue` signature to support sending items to the queue for rendering when a request for a tile which hasn't been rendered before is received. [Issue](https://github.com/mapzen/tilequeue/pull/66) as part of [larger issue](https://github.com/mapzen/tile-tasks/issues/39).

v0.7.0
------
* WOF neighbourhoods with inception and cessation dates are now respected, with those features being hidden from tiles. [Issue](https://github.com/mapzen/tilequeue/issues/59).
* The WOF update process is now robust to intermittent HTTP errors. This could help if you've been experiencing occasional WOF update failures. [Issue](https://github.com/mapzen/vector-datasource/tilequeue/60).

v0.6.1
------
* Made the WOF processor robust to missing `lbl:longitude` and `lbl:latitude` properties by falling back to the geometry's position. This isn't as good as the label position, but better than erroring.

v0.6.0
------
* Added a date prefix to be used to distinguish between different versions of the tiles in the store. This means it's not necessary to create a new bucket for each release.
* Added a hash prefix for files stored in an S3 bucket. This is recommended practice for distributing load for a bucket across an S3 cluster.

------
* Configure better defaults in sample config

------
* Convert post process config into a list, to support generating dynamic `label_placement`s for more than one input layer.

v0.3.0
------
* Add read_tile to store interface

0.2.0
-----
* Stable
